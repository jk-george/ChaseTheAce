# ChaseTheAce
A repository for my initial capstone project creating a game of Chase the Ace.

Card deck is shuffled without the Aces of Hearts, Clubs and Diamonds.

Cards are then dealt out to the players in the game.

You will play against the other opponents (computer).

Your objective is to get rid of all of the cards in your hand. You get rid of cards by having pairs in your hand. You will have the chance to remove more pairs by taking it in turns to pick a card from an adjacent player. The player to the other side of you will pick from you and so on. This will leave the Ace of Spades remaining at the end.

Whoever has the Ace of Spades at the end will lose the game.
